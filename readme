1.you need to understand var function  space
2.in computeday.c you need to note that get input donot \n!!!!!
3.the struct of c donot include function
4.you need to grasp use c++ sort to sort string.
5.qinghuasort.c  show that how to get string input and int put
6.c++ can use include<queue> to push all kinds of elements,for example

struct n {
int a;
int b;


};

queue <N> q;
N yangming;
q.psuh(yangming);
q.pop()//pop
q.empty()
N now=q.front();

7.&& || != usual operator;
8.continue is to out the loop siwthch  to next.but break is to break the loop

9.we take action is
int a,b,c to get int input
while(scanf("%d%%d%d",&a,&b,&c)!=EOF);

10.break can break for and while loop;

11.get char input idonot understand p188
   char a[8][8];
   while(scanf("%s",a[i])!=0)
